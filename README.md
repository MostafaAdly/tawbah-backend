# tawbah-backend
This is the main backend of the tawbah Azkar server, Mainly it sends azkar in a frequent way that the connected user can change to the way he likes.

For installation:
- You must have Java 8 or higher on your machine.
- Just download all files in the "downloadable content/" directory.
- You can change the port of the server that is running on from the start.bat file (eg: if you want to change it to 5033, just make the content of start.bat "java -jar TawbahBackendServer.jar 5033")

Thanks for reading.
